# HubSpot Portal Syncer

Collection of simple tools that allow syncing several HubSpot portal together.

Developed in [Mayple](https://www.mayple.com).

## Portal Property Syncer

Sync the properties of contacts, companies, deals and tickets from one portal to another.
At the end of execution, it lets you know what manual operations you are required to do.
NOTE: right now, this only creates new properties in the target portal, it does update existing properties to be like the source.
Set the appropriate API keys and portal IDs to the portals you wish to sync, update the pairs and run it. Fairly simple.
